## 👋Introduction
This a model which is the best functioning i have done till today, not only its light and fast, it also takes user input and has a **72%-80%** accuracy score. <br>
The model we have used is **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**, which works bit differently than Logistics Regression model. <br>
The data set I have used is a popular, its called **Pima Indians Diabetes** dataset, which is for diabetes in indian women. <br>
This asks basics questions about you from age, blood pressure.. etc, and tries to predict if you have diabetes or not. <br>

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset for this project is avaiable on **kaggle** and **huggingface**. <br>
You can download them directly from: [HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv?download=true) <br>
You can download it automatically by running: <br>
```bash
curl  -L -o main/diabetes.csv https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv
```

## 🧠 Tech Stack
Python • Sklearn • Numpy • Pandas

---

## 🚀 Getting started
Run these commands on Terminal: <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adarsh-v-h/diabetes-prediction.git 
cd diabetes-prediction 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python main/main.py 
```
But its good to create a separate environment before doing that, we can create that by running:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Then to run it:
```bash
\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate
```
But if you are on linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 📈 Result
Model Accuracy: 0.72-0.8 <br>
F1 Score: 0.79
