This a model which is the best functioning i have done till today, not only its light and fast, it also takes user input and has a 72%-80% accuracy score.
The model we have used is SVM, which works bit differently than Logistics Regression model. 
The data set I have used is famous around, its called Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is for indian women. 
This asks basics questions about you from age, blood pressure.. etc, and tries to predict if you have diabetes or not.
This project is engineered with a high growth ceiling and designed for scalable expansion, capable of handling exponentially larger datasets and complex feature implementations.
