## ðŸ‘‹Introduction
This a model which is the best functioning i have done till today, not only its light and fast, it also takes user input and has a **72%-80%** accuracy score. <br>
The model we have used is **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**, which works bit differently than Logistics Regression model. <br>
The data set I have used is a popular, its called **Pima Indians Diabetes** dataset, which is for diabetes in indian women. <br>
This asks basics questions about you from age, blood pressure.. etc, and tries to predict if you have diabetes or not. <br>

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset for this project is avaiable on **kaggle** and **huggingface**. <br>
You can download them directly from: [HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv?download=true) <br>
You can download it automatically by running: <br>
```bash
curl  -L -o main/diabetes.csv https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv
```

## ðŸ‘‹ Before you leave
Thank you checkout my project and I hope it was helpful, I am open for any future collaboration. <br>
This project is engineered with a high growth ceiling and designed for scalable expansion, capable of handling exponentially larger datasets and complex feature implementations. If we get a better dataset we can make it detect more accurately and maybe even more than just mine or rock
