## ðŸ‘‹Introduction
This a model which is the best functioning i have done till today, not only its light and fast, it also takes user input and has a 72%-80% accuracy score.
The model we have used is SVM, which works bit differently than Logistics Regression model. 
The data set I have used is famous around, its called Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is for indian women. 
This asks basics questions about you from age, blood pressure.. etc, and tries to predict if you have diabetes or not.


## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset for this project is avaiable on kaggle and huggingface.
You can download them directly from: [HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv?download=true)
You can download it automatically by running:
'''bash
curl  -L -o main/diabetes.csv https://huggingface.co/datasets/TahaGorji/DiabetesDeepInsight-CSV/resolve/main/diabetes.csv

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Python â€¢ Sklearn â€¢ Numpy â€¢ Pandas

## ðŸš€ Getting started
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/adarsh-v-h/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main/main.py

## ðŸ“ˆ Result
Model Accuracy: 0.72-0.8
F1 Score: 0.79

## ðŸ‘‹ Before you leave
Thank you checkout my project and I hope it was helpful, I am open for any future collaboration.
This project is engineered with a high growth ceiling and designed for scalable expansion, capable of handling exponentially larger datasets and complex feature implementations.
